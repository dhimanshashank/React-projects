# React Projects

## Overview
Welcome to my collection of React projects! This repository serves as a showcase of my ongoing and upcoming projects developed using React. Each project is an opportunity to explore different aspects of web development and enhance my skills in creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces. Also, I am structuring it into different version to enhance my structured learning and building projects from scratch.

## Projects Included
- **To-Do App:** A simple task management application that allows users to add and delete tasks. This project helped me understand the basics of React components, state management, and event handling.
- **Bharat Clock:** A real-time clock application displaying the current date and time in Bharat (India). This project deepened my knowledge of React hooks, particularly `useEffect` and `useState`, for managing time-based updates.
- **CustomReact Renderer:** A simplified rendering function that mimics React's rendering process. This project involved creating a custom render function that takes a JavaScript object representing a React element and renders it as a DOM element. Through this exercise, I gained a deeper understanding of how React manages the Virtual DOM, reconciles changes, and applies attributes to DOM nodes. This hands-on experience also helped me explore modular programming concepts and DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.

## Goals and Learnings
### Goals
- **Skill Development:** Enhance my proficiency in React and related technologies.
- **Project-Based Learning:** Apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios through diverse projects.
- **Portfolio Building:** Create a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my abilities to potential employers and collaborators.

### Learnings
1. **React Components:** Understanding the fundamentals of building reusable components and managing component state.
2. **State Management:** Learning how to effectively manage and update state within a React application.
3. **Event Handling:** Gaining insights into handling user interactions and events in a React environment.
4. **React Hooks:** Utilizing hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects in functional components.
5. **Styling:** Experimenting with different styling methods, including CSS and inline styles, to create visually appealing interfaces.
6. **Project Structuring:** Organizing code and project files in a maintainable and scalable manner.

## Installation and Usage
